# transcriber
This code takes Youtube video and generates associated mp3 in bucket and genrates associate Transcripts using machine learning based AWS api. :party_parrot

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. The task you described sounds interesting and involves a combination of different AWS services to achieve the goal.

To summarize the process:

1. **Input**: A YouTube video (presumably the URL or video ID) is provided as input for the process.

2. **Generate MP3**: Using AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon S3, the video is downloaded from YouTube and processed to extract the audio. The audio is then converted into an MP3 format, which is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

3. **Transcription with Machine Learning**: AWS offers a service called Amazon Transcribe, which uses machine learning to convert speech to text. The generated MP3 file is sent to Amazon Transcribe, which processes the audio and generates a transcript containing the speech content.

4. **Transcript Storage**: The resulting transcript is stored in a suitable format, such as JSON or plain text, in another Amazon S3 bucket.

By using this process, you can automatically generate an MP3 audio file and its corresponding transcript based on a given YouTube video. This can be useful for various applications, such as content indexing, accessibility, or data analysis.

If you plan to implement this workflow, be sure to review the specific services' documentation and consider the cost implications, especially if processing a large number of videos. Also, consider any copyright or licensing issues related to downloading and processing YouTube videos. Always ensure that you comply with YouTube's terms of service and any applicable laws and regulations.
